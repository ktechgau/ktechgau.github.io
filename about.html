            <h3>Beautician and a Geek</h3>
            <p>
              After running a successful beauty salon for 17 years, I've
              embarked on a new journey in the field of IT and software
              development.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently enrolled in a Certificate IV in IT, I'm also part of the
              She Codes Australia Perth Plus cohort. This project-based program
              spans six months and encompasses five distinct projects. These
              projects involve a variety of skills and technologies, including
              creating websites using HTML/CSS, data manipulation with Python,
              and working with frameworks like Django and React JS.
            </p>
            <p>
              This transition represents a significant shift from my previous
              career, and it's an exciting opportunity to explore my passion for
              technology and coding. The She Codes program offers a hands-on
              approach to building practical skills, and I'm looking forward to
              applying my newfound knowledge in the world of IT and software
              development.

            <p>
              When I am not learning to code you may find me somewhere outdoors!</p>
              <p>
              Hiking, snorkelling and excersise are a few of my favourite
              things. I am also a mother, a wife, a good friend and a team
              player in a women's softball club I love quotes, lists, coffee and
              any food that I didn't have to cook myself!
